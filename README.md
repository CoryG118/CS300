This program is designed to help ABC University organize and recall couse information. I considered what would be efficient for both the client and myself when coding. For these reasons I chosed to use a 
Binary Search Tree to organize the information. Fortunately, there are multiple resources to compare my project in order to overcome any roadblocks I faced. What this project has taught me is that there are 
many ways to organize information, and in the future I will be analyizing what will be the most efficient for me and the client.
